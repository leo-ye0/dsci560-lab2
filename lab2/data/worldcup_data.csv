Would it be better for the USA to not compete next year?,"Even though the US is hosting, the US team is so dreadful that they'd bring the level of competition down and set a new low record for performance as a host. The team is CLEARLY worse than Qatar. At least Qatar won an Asian Cup before hosting while the US looked like ass in the Concacaf Gold Cup despite hosting it. Canada and Mexico are much better teams and both countries are more serious and competitive than the US.

I'm American and I hate everything US footy/soccer does as this country is not serious about the sport and makes no substantial efforts to improve and grow the game or even have the bare minimum of a youth system. Giving the WC to an unserious country was a bad idea at first, but since it's too late to strip the US of hosting right we still can right the wrong in not let the US compete. If they want, let the US team play a few tune-up friendlies before the WC so the American pampered pansy players can get their 15 min. of shame.

Europe: Why have some groups played half of the matches whereas other groups have yet to play any manches,Why have some groups played half of the matches whereas other groups have yet to play any manches,19,25,"['Because UEFA was astoundingly stupid to come up with Nations League quarterfinals, which disrupted international calendar a lot. Moreover, they were even able to top their stupidity by opting for a 12-group format which, I feel, is in place to avoid clashes between top teams and make sure all of them make the World Cup easily.', ""It's because of the Nation's League - also just to clarify, UEFA have never had equal groups - the previous qualification campaigns saw some groups have 5 teams while others had 6 for example. This would lead to some teams starting off with two matches, 1 or rarely none.\n\nAnyways, it's the Nations League that is causing this along with the expansion of slots available to UEFA which is now at 16. This caused more groups to be made. I'll do my best to explain since it's a little convoluted;\n\nWC Qualification starts for UEFA in March 2025, the Nations League is played in the March and June 2025 windows (that's the Finals in June when it wraps up).\n\nSo, this is what UEFA did; the 4 teams in the Nations League finals were guaranteed to be drawn into a 4-team group. In this case it was Spain, Germany, France and Portugal. They could not start qualification until September along with everyone else in their group - so that explains why all the 4-team groups are starting qualification now in the September window.\n\nThe groups which have 5 teams could only have 1 team participating in Nations League matches during the March 2025 window - which then means that the other 4 teams in the groups of 5 could have matches in the March & June windows. Those teams who lost in the quarter-finals of the Nations League would then start their WC Qualification in June 2025. This is the reason why it's all over the place in terms of matchups, and you see the 5-team groups have teams which have played more matches then the rest.\n\nDespite all of this, the actually amount of matches has not changed during the international window for teams and the qualification for this round will end at the same time in November.\n\n\\-\n\nI really hope I explained this alright."", 'To incentivise the Nations League ie the top teams supposedly get easier riders by placing in smaller groups and kicking off later.', ""Everyone's mentioning the nations league, but i think it just comes down to numbers. 54 teams are vying for 16 spots. There are several that have almost no shot just due to having an incredibly small population.\n\nSo if they just had 16 groups, we'd have pairings of 3 or 4 teams. Given the past record of groupings of 3, specifically the disgrace of Gij√≥n, they won't want to do that.\n\nIn order to make it groupings of 4 at a minimum, you'd still have some groups of 5. With 14 groups, two will have a grouping of 5, which extends the number of match days from 6 to 10. That sort of window doesn't really bode well for the teams that get put into those larger groups, as it takes a lot more resources from the national football organizations to coordinate and transport their team.\n\nBut now you have another problem. There are 2 more spots to give, and 14 runners up. How do you split them up and assign the last two spots without them having played each other?\n\nSo they settled on the middle of the road solution to have 12 groups, 12 runners up along with the top 4 nations league contenders play off for those last spots."", 'Each regional organization has its own system and timing for deciding how to select the World Cup entrants.']"

"Real Madrid, Barcelona, Bayern and Inter players in World Cup final","So I'm sure everyone knows about the Bayern and Inter players featuring in the final.
However, the two Spanish giants do have a part too. In 6 out of 7 last editions, one of the finalist had players from both clubs.

1998 & 2002 - Roberto Carlos & Rivaldo
2010 - Almost half of Spain's squad
2014 - Messi & Di Maria
2018 - Varane & Umtiti, Rakitic & Modric
2022 - Dembele, Kounde, Tchouameni & Camavinga

So base on these, combined with Bayern and Inter, one of the finalist will have players from at least 3 of the clubs mentioned above.

So right now, France and Brazil have players from those clubs.
Another possible team is England, depending if Barca decides to buy Rashford permanently at the end of the season.

South Africa‚Äôs unique home ground advantage in the qualifiers,"South Africa were drawn in CAF Group C together with Nigeria, Rwanda, Zimbabwe and Lesotho.

South Africa have the following fixtures remaining:
Lesotho (a) 
Nigeria (h) 
Zimbabwe (a)
Rwanda (h)

Shame on them for not qualifying,  absolute bums couldn\'t beat Lesotho IN NIGERIA\n\nThey also should have been yelling about this since the beginning of qualifying because its been publicly known for some time and completely ridiculous that so many ""away games"" in WC qualifying would be in south Africa, clear unfair advantage \n\n\nBut even besides all this, the bigger scandal is Morocco as there away games being in Morocco make no geographic sense what\'s so ever.', 'Nigeria is screwed. They can‚Äôt afford to lose.']"
World cup expansion has completely ruined the qualification process. Time to scrap the procession and insert more meaningful fixtures.,"I'm looking ahead to this week's World cup qualifiers and all I can see is a bunch of mismatch encounters across the entire global qualification.

What a waste of time? I'm looking for a game that I might want to watch and the best I can  find in terms of quality and jeopardy is Poland's trip to the Netherlands and Italy taking on Israel.

No disrespect... but what a load of crap UEFA is serving up otherwise.

The whole thing is pointless. The qualifiers are supposed to be the first part of the world cup. All I see is a procession.

South America is frankly embarrassing at this point. Venezuela or Bolivia making the playoff is literally all that's left to decide! No jeopardy. Nothing to play for. Pointless exercise.

The whole thing needs a rethink.

Why are we all waiting around scratching our arses for FOUR years for the CHANCE of these games maybe happening?",0,109,"['Realistically how many ‚Äúbig‚Äù teams are there? 10? 15 maybe?

Most games were meaningful, but it wasn\'t as brutally difficult to qualify as the 16 and 24 team versions.\n\n\nYou could maybe get the best of both worlds by holding a ""pre-tournament"".\n\n\n48 qualifying spots from confederations, the best 16 qualifiers get automatic finals places, the remaining 32 play an 8x4 group stage to fill the other 16 places.\n\n\nIt could be held maybe 6 months before the full tournament as a dry run for the organisers.', 'If you are disregarding matchups based on name recognition you‚Äôre missing out. Georgia vs Turkey was an entertaining game today', 'The Asian and African federations have it right.\n\nPre qualifying in UEFA before playing the seeded teams is so much better. It could be like league systems where the 4th best team gets relegated into the pool of 5/6th teams etc. \n\nBut, at the same time, you have to remember that players from the likes of San Marino might not ever get the chance to play against England or France in their lives so this is their opportunity.']"

Unpopular Opinion: Martinez is not that bad as a NT coach,"I've heard from left to right that Roberto Martinez is too limited and a profitional talent-wasting coach. I, myself included, critized him for being stubborn, way too defensive like our previous coach and way too gentle in the attacking aproach knowing Portugal's team can provoke damage upfront. I always saw him as a ""I tell 100 motivational quotes, and do O actions"". Well, even Portugal FA drew a limit l.ine where if he didn't win the NL, he would be fired and replaced by Mourinho or JJ. This made me root for the first time ever agaisnt Portugal; from facing Denmark to the last game. Until today, many of us think this is the final nail to the ""Ronaldo ultimate chance to win the WC"" coffin.

But hear me out:

For my own surprise, not only I think Mourinho wouldn't be an upgrade, but Caillou (as we like to call it xD) put an end to some locker room disputes, manage to give us our first ever win agaisnt Germany since 2000, pulled up a NL trophy from the current best team in the world, made cirurgical substitutions that ended up in goals and turned us into a hard-to-score side. Finally, I think we are more united as ever.

Anybody welcome to give its opinion :)",12,8,"[""Martinez being shit is a twitter/social media bantz brainrot meme.  Just like the dunking on Harry Maguire a few years ago.  Something not really based in reality but makes it easy for people to farm engagement and make 'hilarious' soundbites.    \n\nLike do they really think Belgium should have beaten France in 2018?  Also the only team to beat Belgium in russia, and in euro 2020 went on to win the whole thing.  Maybe you could say they could have done better in the nations league, but does anyone really care about that until the business end?  And he couldn't stop them from imploding at wc 2022, so thats another demerit, but they should have refreshed long before then, either with the squad, or the man himself.  \n\nHe's no Guardiola, but he's a decent international manager."", 'As a Belgian, I strongly disagree']"

*Certain scenarios could be updated depending on Matchday 7 results*

As for the rest of the other confederations if you are wondering:

CONCACAF:
- Round 3 will kick off this window with two matchdays and will do so for the October & November windows.
- Round 3 will consist 3 groups of 4 teams with 1st place in each group earning direct qualification and the two best 2nd place teams advancing to the Intercontinental Play-offs. 

AFC: 
- Round 4 will kick off and conclude in October. 
- Round 4 consists 2 groups of 3 teams with the 1st place teams clinching the final two direct spots of Asian qualifers while the 2nd place teams advance to Round 5 in November which will consist of a two legged tie (home & away) to determine who will advance to the Intercontinental Play-offs 

UEFA: 
- European qualifers are set to continue after where they last left off from the June window.
- All six groups that consists of only 4 teams will finally kick off

OFC: 
- Oceania qualifers have already concluded in the March window this year
- New Zealand üá≥üáø earned the confederation's sole guaranteed spot while New Caledonia üá≥üá® advanced to the Intercontinental Play-offs 

If your team is still in contention and could qualify this window then I wish your country the best of luck.

I will make another post regarding the 2nd matchday of this window soon after the 1st matchday of the window and will mention clinching scenarios regarding the Intercontinental Play-offs.",41,28,"['In terms of timing, the only team from Africa that can qualify after matchday 7, as far as I can tell, is Morocco. They have a 6 point difference over 2nd place Tanzania, who they have beaten twice and thus win on head-to-head. \n\nHowever, their next game (against Niger) is after the games in South America, so the next qualifier will most likely be one of Paraguay, Uruguay or Colombia, depending on results and which team finishes their game first. If Venezuela lose to Argentina before any of the other games finish, then all 3 will qualify at the same time.', 'I would agree on Morocco üá≤üá¶ being the first team to qualify out of Africa but I can even say us Ghana üá¨üá≠ we could do it too if we beat both Chad and Mali and Comoros drop points', 'In CONCACAF, there are only three groups where the first place seeds advance and the two highest 2nd place seeds still have to play it out in the inter-confederation playoffs. The teams expected to win the group are Panama, Jamaica, and Costa Rica and the other two are up for grabs. As a reminder - the US, Mexico and Canada are already qualified since they are the hosts.', ""Just remove those flags It's hard to read and annoying.""]"
Fifa Panini sticker albums worldwide (popularity).,Are the panini world cup sticker albums popular all over the world? They are big in Mexico. I'm curious if anyone here from Asia or Africa has heard of it or seen it? I've been doing them in USA and Mexico since 2002 and i still do it as a full grown adult.,19,13,"['They‚Äôre a big thing in Argentina.', 'I have been living in Canada (not Canadian) for the last 4 years and no the only people who engage in exchanging stickers are Latinos', 'Brazil too', 'Big in the UK. Or they were. Ridiculously expensive now, though.', 'It‚Äôs big in most of Latin America']"
Underrated teams that could qualify for the World Cup,"Now that all the WCQ will be playing I wanted to ask an interesting question. Does anybody have a team that would is sneakily good and is underrated to qualify from any of the confederations.

Obviously there are underrated teams like Greece, Sweden and DR Congo that have been projected to qualify and been hyped up a lot recently or have favorable draws. But I'm mainly talking teams no one is really talking about when we think about who would qualify for the world cup. For me I picked Sudan and Wales. 

Now with Wales they are in a really good spot, having earned direct promo in the UNL at least securing them a playoff spot, they already played Belgium and Wales away so they don't have to deal with that anymore, I definitely have them beating Macedonia and possibly taking points or maybe a W against Belgium at home, they should obviously take care of Kazakhstan and Lichtenstein. Also I don't want to hype up losing to much but after watching the Belgium away match and how they came back from 3-0 down after halftime made me think their something about this team, they will probably enter the playoffs and for the most part all those teams will be somewhat around the same level expect for some odd ones (Possibly Italy and Moldova),so there's really no reason why they can't at least have hope.

Now Sudan I haven't seen them play this good in a long time. The big thing about them really is how good their defense is, I mean they qualified for the AFCON over Ghana for crying out loud. Their is a big question though after tying South Sudan and if that could possibly tank their chances on getting second. I really didn't expect them to be challenging DRC and Senegal like this. Especially with everything going on down there.

Now I was thinking of Kosovo and Bosnia as my hotter takes but I wanna wait and see with these upcoming fixtures first. I also was thinking Gabon since they pretty much are beating everyone in their group besides Ivory coast but they do have a tendency to choke. Also Cape Verde is really impressing me a lot, sucks we won't see them at the AFCON. If any of you have any possible answers just put them down below.",14,28,"['Guatemala is my pick. Not only have they done pretty well the last couple of years (got to Gold Cup semifinal just a couple of months back), but Concacaf has a bunch of spots at play. 3 direct and 2 playoff spots give them a huge chance + they have a massive following', 'Italy. /s\n\nQualifying has barely begun and they are already at risk of not making it.', 'Indonesia. They are basically the Dutch 4th team but might just sneak pass Saudi and Iraq in the 4th qualifying round.', 'For me, Curacao can perfectly hit the ground running and win its group against Jamaica. It would become the smallest country to participate in any World Cup.', 'Venezuela. I think that if they clinch a play-off berth, they should have no issues qualifying for the World Cup. They‚Äôve always been almost there, but never really there, as they‚Äôre somewhat good but not good enough to make it in through Conmebol Qualifiers. In any other qualifiers, expect UEFA‚Äôs, they would‚Äôve already made it. \n\nThey look in better shape than past years and had a decent qualifiers for their own standards. For a team that‚Äôs on the same tier as, say, M√©xico and the US, they should have no trouble winning against the likes of New Caledonia, Guatemala and Honduras. The real challenge might come from either whoever gets to represent CAF or AFC in the play-offs but I doubt there‚Äôll be much difference in ranks, so they won‚Äôt probably face each other.']"

I'm asking in terms of proportion of the population that watches and/or follows professional association football.",39,144,"['In Australia, ‚ÄúSoccer‚Äù has a larger proportion when it comes to (non-cricket) ball sports by virtue of the fact that there‚Äôs also a big geographical rift between Rugby League (NRL aka ‚ÄòFooty‚Äô in Queensland and NSW) and AFL (‚ÄòAussie Rules aka ‚ÄòFooty‚Äô in all the other states.)\nIn Victoria for instance Soccer is the number 2 sport behind AFL', 'Very high participation levels in Australia, but not a big earner as a televised professional sport/business.', ""NZ is kind of strange.

Premier League gets a bit of news airtime especially with Chris Wood doing well and it isn't that odd to see people on the streets in an Arsenal or United shirt or whatever.\n\nThere's a lot of youth participation, but there's a lot of youth participation in most sports here.\n\nI think I'd say it's biggest in Australia.

People always show out for the men\'s team during World Cups too.\xa0\n\n\nThe problem Australia has is there\'s no unified football ""identity"" in the country. In the UK, if you like football then you probably have a club team you watch and support every week, then you watch the national team with keen interest. It\'s a kind of monoculture that way.\n\n\nIn Australia, there\'s tragics like me who follow my local A League club, watch European football and watch the national teams every game. But then there\'s others who don\'t care for the A League and only watch the EPL. Some people will jump on board the national teams but only at a World Cup and don\'t even realise there\'s qualifiers or the Asian Cup too. A lot of women love the Matildas and the players, but don\'t actually pick a club team to follow, they just follow the Matildas players movements. My partner once said she liked Arsenal AND Tottenham because they each had a handful of Matildas players. I had to explain why this would be heresy in the UK.\xa0\n\n\nIt just creates a fractured fan base that never looks that big, but when it gets going in the same direction like at the World Cup, it\'s great\xa0', ""It's always struck me as being weird that so many of the countries where football is less popular are former British colonies.""]"
I had this wild crazy dream that Southeast Asia and Oceania would unite to produce a legendary 64 nation world cup,"Just imagine all the possibilities... The best 64 nations in the entire world... Because at some point the world cup will have 64 nations... Blame Infantino and Fifa... And these 64 divided into 4 regions... Each with 4 groups of 4 until the winner of each for then a final four selected in two stadiums... ü•∞Chef Kiss... 

Like, I know that it is too many teams but I see some pros in favour... Less games in qualification rounds, so, they can be shorter and some more time is allowed for other tournments and events... Club world cup that now they are considering being 2 in 2 years, nations league, and the rest... 

We hould have for each of 1 of the 4 regions,  4 main stadiums plus 1 auxiliar for group stages in a total of 16 + 4 stadiums in a bid. Just like 2002 wc with Japan and South Korea of 20 stadiums.

Region 1: IndoChina

Main Stadiums (4)
Thailand‚Äì National Stadium of Bangkok (~50k)

Thailand ‚Äì New World cup stadium planned around Bangkok in Muang Thong Thani (45k) confirmed

Camboja ‚ÄìNational Stadium -  Morodok Techo (60k) Such a wolderful stadium, it kinda is the perfect one for the quarter final and final game of this region... At least in terms of capacity... 

Vietnam‚Äì M·ªπ ƒê√¨nh (40k) 

Auxiliar (1):

Myanmar ‚Äì Thuwunna (50k, needs renovation, myammar preferable for group stages, doesn't have the hospitality required for major games)


Region 2 -  Malaysia + Singapure

Main Stadiums(4)

Malaysia ‚Äì Bukit Jalil national stadium (87k)

Malaysia ‚Äì Shah Alam (45k, new stadium on the lines for a world cup)

Malaysia ‚Äì Sultan Ibrahim (40k)

Singapure ‚Äì National Stadium (50k)

Auxiliar (1):

Mal√°sia ‚Äì Penang/Ipoh (redevelopment of one stadium in one of the cities - either Perak Stadium or State of Penang, ~40k, Ipoh and Penang have solid hospitality for a wc but due to the fact that it still requires a wc worthy stadium it gets to be more of an auxiliar. Maybe State of Penang is a solid choice for a basic stadium)

Region 3 -  Indonesia

Principais (4):

Gelora Bung Karno (77k, Jacarta)

Jakarta International Stadium (82k)

Gelora Bung Tomo (45k, Surabaya)

Batakan (40k, Balikpapan/Samarinda, helped as well in hospitality by the new capital Nusantara) 

the wc can help with some large investment in Nusantara... And as well with the new project for Jakarta to not sink in the ocean... Plus projects like sending down water to the underground soil so that it stops from sinking... The situation is a lot like Mexico City and a little bit of Tokyo but with fewer money than Tokyo for projects and on the coast unlike Mexico City... Surely you can't abandon a city like Jakarta right? 

Auxiliar (1):

Riau Main Stadium (Pekanbaru, 42k, low hospitality capacity, gets to represent the northern island)


Region  4 Australia + New Zealand

Main Stadiums(4) - east coast stadiums selected, non oval stadiums in the line

Sydney ‚Äì Accor Stadium (82k) - the biggest stadium and better one for finals to football... Chance to get a retractable for future events

Sydney ‚Äì Allianz Stadium (42.5k)

Brisbane ‚Äì Suncorp Stadium (55k)

Auckland ‚Äì Eden Park 2.0 (50k, renovation plans of the line, retangular configuration plans on the line to host wc matches - something that New Zealand has already talked about with Infantino - hosting matches with the USA and other pacific islands and countries)

Auxiliar (1):

Newcastle ‚Äì McDonald Jones Stadium (42k, the reform in 2011 allowed for the stadium to be used in wc with temporary stands on the north and south, city in the coast but also with a lower hospitality capacity and a much lower importance of the stadium and city compared to the other four)



C'mon, I know that you will call me crazy but it kinda looks good... You then have a final four maybe in Australia, Malaysia or Indonesia... The three countries to have 80k+ capacity stadiums... Like the final four of the nations league... Two stadiums, in this case, 4 matches... All to play for



Edit:

For Australia and New Zealand  - a possible change

Sydney ‚Äì Accor Stadium (82k) -

Melbourne - Melbourne Cricket Ground - can be adapted, a study of Fifa in the stadium envolved rectangular temporary stands for the lower tier on top of the existing ones for better vieweing, capacity reduced to 88k. 
Marvel Stadium is out of the question since it has a private management

Brisbane ‚Äì Suncorp Stadium (55k)

Auckland ‚Äì Eden Park 2.0 (50k)

Auxiliar

Allianz Stadium (42.5k) - it is a perfect stadium to include.

Your alternative ideas for the group stage in a world cup of 48 nations,"Straight to the point...

One said, a champions league version... Very hard... How are you going to play 24 games at the same time? Every match at the same time for the final round does not give any money to Fifa... And there would be needed 24 stadiums ... 

However a fusion with my idea of 8 groups of 6 might turn out to be fine... How?  (There was a comment with an idea very similar to what I will write)

You have 3 pots of 16 teams each. One of the 16 favourites for pot A, the non 16 favourites for pot C and the rest 16 for pot B. Each group would have 2 teams of each pot. And with 3 rounds each team would play against one team of each pot by draw. 
I kinda see 3 rounds as enough to get 4 qualifiers out of the 6. Then you would have the choice... In the champions league version of snooker, the 4 advance and there is a semi final and final of the group. (1st vs 4th, 2nd vs 3rd and then the final). You would get by 5 matches 1 getting out of the group to advance for the quarter finals.  In another way, a more world football cup way is to cross the 4 going through of one group with the 4 of another group...

1st group A vs 4th group B
2nd group A vs 3rd group B
3rd group A vs 2nd group B
4th group A vs 1st group B

And so with each 2 groups of the 8 crossing each other you would get to the semis with the 4 remaining teams. The true final 4. So, you get a round of 32 without 3rd place complications and all based on merit considering the 3 matches played in the group stage. Obvioulsy the final round needs to have it's final three games played at the same time. This allows also for better disposal of each 12 teams in each part of the host nation. Usa, Brasil or China are two very distant nations. Make like 4 zones for each 2 groups and then select one final zone for the final four. Maybe in the middle of the country... In the Usa would be the At&t stadium with 80k capacity to get the final for example. 

Coming back to your ideas, I did like one suggestion to avoid a round of 32... 
The top 8 of the first place get a bye and the 4 remaining and the 12 placed in second play a round of 16 as a qualifier for the eights of the world cup. Very likeable. Many did prefer this one. 
But probably not one to consider by Fifa since they probably want the 3rd place vs 4th place games to get more exciting.

In my fusion with groups of 6 plus champions league there is a possible drama until the end. 9 points for grabs... Solid games being played, the final round very exciting to see who goes through... And possibly to see who plays against who in another group. 

Here, I will leave it at that... My idea will probably not get better than this for groups of 6... I like the 8 of 1st place getting a bye... Less games overall... A little more rest for the ones who  in the majority played better... Scored better and all...

"Ok, so then, why should there not be groups of 6 for the World cup?","Ok, so, the main topic here will probably be the number of games... but with the new 48 nation format... The winning team plays 3 matches in the group stage and 5 matches in the elimination rounds... I do not like the 3rd place qualification so I'm trying to think about other ways... In my way maybe 9 games...

48 teams, 8 groups of 6... Now it depends for how many teams go through... In handball these 6 nation groups happens and only the two best ranked nations advance to the next stage.
So, if this were to happen... If only 2 of the 6 go through... You have a 32 team cut... 16 teams in the elimination rounds... Total of games... 9 possible... 5 in group stage and 4 in the elimination rounds...

An idea that you are going to hate but I kinda like it about group matches,"Everyone has been talking about the 48 nation world cup...
A lot of talk has been made with how exhaustive matches can get with this many games so I just thought that in 48 groups of 3 if these are propperly done a world cup can be successfull...

The only thing needed is a win per match in a group stage. If after 90 minutes of game the match is tied, penalties immediatelly after. Each group would have 1 team with 6 points, 1 with 3 and 1 with 0. 


Every team would have two shots to go through, two games, two deciding games and you would have one game less and you would cut all of that 3rd place crap. 

Or, a double elimination round instead of the group stage. Instead of a group stage you give a nation two chances to go through maybe...

Like this: 
You start by team A play against team C of the draw in match 1.
Losing team of match 1 (L1) plays against team B in match 2
The winner of match 2 (W2) plays against the winner of match 1 (W3). And now either one team goes through or both go throughand you have the one in the draw 1 of the winners and the one in draw 2 of the losers. 

This last match needs to be played at the same time as the other last match of the group to each both 4 teams will play against one another. 



Final note... This way you could have for each set of 12 teams one country hosting these until the one surviving nation to play a final four. Like...maybe 2 for Australia + New Zealand with 6 to 8 stadiums, 1 for Indonesia with 4 , 1 for Malaysia + Singapore with 4 stadiums. Total of 14-16 stadiums... With the final four being in Australia and New Zealand (two stadiums, Australia Stadium and Eden Park).
