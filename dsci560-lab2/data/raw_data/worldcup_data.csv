"Real Madrid, Barcelona, Bayern and Inter players in World Cup final","So I'm sure everyone knows about the Bayern and Inter players featuring in the final.
However, the two Spanish giants do have a part too. In 6 out of 7 last editions, one of the finalist had players from both clubs.

1998 & 2002 - Roberto Carlos & Rivaldo
2010 - Almost half of Spain's squad
2014 - Messi & Di Maria
2018 - Varane & Umtiti, Rakitic & Modric
2022 - Dembele, Kounde, Tchouameni & Camavinga

So base on these, combined with Bayern and Inter, one of the finalist will have players from at least 3 of the clubs mentioned above.

So right now, France and Brazil have players from those clubs.
Another possible team is England, depending if Barca decides to buy Rashford permanently at the end of the season.

World cup expansion has completely ruined the qualification process. Time to scrap the procession and insert more meaningful fixtures.,"I'm looking ahead to this week's World cup qualifiers and all I can see is a bunch of mismatch encounters across the entire global qualification.

What a waste of time? I'm looking for a game that I might want to watch and the best I can  find in terms of quality and jeopardy is Poland's trip to the Netherlands and Italy taking on Israel.

No disrespect... but what a load of crap UEFA is serving up otherwise.

The whole thing is pointless. The qualifiers are supposed to be the first part of the world cup. All I see is a procession.

South America is frankly embarrassing at this point. Venezuela or Bolivia making the playoff is literally all that's left to decide! No jeopardy. Nothing to play for. Pointless exercise.

The whole thing needs a rethink.

I want to see Spain play Argentina. France take on Brazil.

I get it‚Äôs fun to watch the top teams play, but there‚Äôs more than just France and Brazil when it comes to international soccer. \n\nSort of feels like ‚Äúforget you if you‚Äôre not a top 10 country‚Äù? Morocco just made the semi-finals of the World Cup. We saw Costa Rica with some big upsets not too long ago. I get not being thrilled watching a tiny nation lose 10-0, but that‚Äôs a relatively smaller percentage of matches.\n\nEvery nation deserves their shot at glory, no matter the odds', 'Are you new? It‚Äôs always been like this.  Or are you saying you want to see Spain v Argentina in increasingly pointless friendlies because been there and done that', 'It\'s not so much the mismatches in the qualifiers that gets me, as the lack of jeopardy, and the bloat of the finals.\n\n\nWith 48 spots the top teams are basically going through the motions. They\'d have to mess up really badly to not qualify.\n\n\n32 teams always felt like a sweet spot for tournament size. Most games were meaningful, but it wasn\'t as brutally difficult to qualify as the 16 and 24 team versions.\n\n\nYou could maybe get the best of both worlds by holding a ""pre-tournament"".\n\n\n48 qualifying spots from confederations, the best 16 qualifiers get automatic finals places, the remaining 32 play an 8x4 group stage to fill the other 16 places.\n\n\nIt could be held maybe 6 months before the full tournament as a dry run for the organisers.', 'First off, the expansion for UEFA and Conmebol was overdue. Both confederations have the best teams and it was never fair to have their best ones out of the World Cup. In Conmebol‚Äôs case, for example, it was always bulshit to only have 4-5. \n\nThe new UEFA groups seem much fairer, and even then, some of the big teams might fail, like Italy.\nRegardless, if it was in league format, the same teams would qualify either way. There are many interesting matches. \n\nConmebol looks cool to me. Brazil v Chile will be interesting as Ancelotti is trying to find an identity for the team, and Chile is trying to reform itself. The Bolivia and Venezuela fight for the playoffs is interesting. They‚Äôll have to fight out of their weight class to get through. It‚Äôll be one of Messi‚Äôs last matches in Argentina for Argentina. \n\nReal competition is in Africa. Watch the games and see chaotic it can get. \n\nIf you want clashes of giants, wait for the WC and for the international friendlies next year.', 'Turkey vs Georgia is solid tonight', "">The whole thing needs a rethink.\n\nSoooooo...... highest bidder ?\n\nIt's ***on brand*** for FIFA if nothing else."", 'The main positive I see with expansion is that more African teams get the opportunity to qualify. Having only 5 of 40-odd teams get thru in the old format was harsh.\n\nZambia, DR Congo, Cape Verde, Egypt, and Mali are all worthwhile teams that were really hard done by the previous format.', 'The Asian and African federations have it right.\n\nPre qualifying in UEFA before playing the seeded teams is so much better. It could be like league systems where the 4th best team gets relegated into the pool of 5/6th teams etc. \n\nBut, at the same time, you have to remember that players from the likes of San Marino might not ever get the chance to play against England or France in their lives so this is their opportunity.', ""The mismatch has always been a thing. It's the lack of stakes that has somewhat diminished the drama of qualifiers.\n\nAs for Spain vs Argentina you only have to wait till March.""]"
South Africa‚Äôs unique home ground advantage in the qualifiers,"South Africa were drawn in CAF Group C together with Nigeria, Rwanda, Zimbabwe and Lesotho. Well it turns out that Zimbabwe and Lesotho do not have FIFA-accredited facilities to host their home games, and they have opted to play their ‚Äúhome‚Äù qualifiers in neighbouring South Africa. 

South Africa have the following fixtures remaining:
Lesotho (a) 
Nigeria (h) 
Zimbabwe (a)
Rwanda (h)

Now due to Lesotho and Zimbabwe‚Äôs facilities issues, South Africa will almost certainly play all those remaining matches at home.

Unpopular Opinion: Martinez is not that bad as a NT coach,"I've heard from left to right that Roberto Martinez is too limited and a profitional talent-wasting coach. I, myself included, critized him for being stubborn, way too defensive like our previous coach and way too gentle in the attacking aproach knowing Portugal's team can provoke damage upfront. I always saw him as a ""I tell 100 motivational quotes, and do O actions"". Well, even Portugal FA drew a limit l.ine where if he didn't win the NL, he would be fired and replaced by Mourinho or JJ. This made me root for the first time ever agaisnt Portugal; from facing Denmark to the last game. Until today, many of us think this is the final nail to the ""Ronaldo ultimate chance to win the WC"" coffin.

But hear me out:

For my own surprise, not only I think Mourinho wouldn't be an upgrade, but Caillou (as we like to call it xD) put an end to some locker room disputes, manage to give us our first ever win agaisnt Germany since 2000, pulled up a NL trophy from the current best team in the world, made cirurgical substitutions that ended up in goals and turned us into a hard-to-score side. Finally, I think we are more united as ever.

*Certain scenarios could be updated depending on Matchday 7 results*

As for the rest of the other confederations if you are wondering:

- Round 3 will consist 3 groups of 4 teams with 1st place in each group earning direct qualification and the two best 2nd place teams advancing to the Intercontinental Play-offs. 

AFC: 
- Round 4 will kick off and conclude in October. 
- Round 4 consists 2 groups of 3 teams with the 1st place teams clinching the final two direct spots of Asian qualifers while the 2nd place teams advance to Round 5 in November which will consist of a two legged tie (home & away) to determine who will advance to the Intercontinental Play-offs 

UEFA: 
- European qualifers are set to continue after where they last left off from the June window.
- All six groups that consists of only 4 teams will finally kick off

OFC: 
- Oceania qualifers have already concluded in the March window this year
- New Zealand üá≥üáø earned the confederation's sole guaranteed spot while New Caledonia üá≥üá® advanced to the Intercontinental Play-offs 

If your team is still in contention and could qualify this window then I wish your country the best of luck.

Underrated teams that could qualify for the World Cup,"Now that all the WCQ will be playing I wanted to ask an interesting question. Does anybody have a team that would is sneakily good and is underrated to qualify from any of the confederations.

Obviously there are underrated teams like Greece, Sweden and DR Congo that have been projected to qualify and been hyped up a lot recently or have favorable draws. But I'm mainly talking teams no one is really talking about when we think about who would qualify for the world cup. For me I picked Sudan and Wales. 

Now with Wales they are in a really good spot, having earned direct promo in the UNL at least securing them a playoff spot, they already played Belgium and Wales away so they don't have to deal with that anymore, I definitely have them beating Macedonia and possibly taking points or maybe a W against Belgium at home, they should obviously take care of Kazakhstan and Lichtenstein. Also I don't want to hype up losing to much but after watching the Belgium away match and how they came back from 3-0 down after halftime made me think their something about this team, they will probably enter the playoffs and for the most part all those teams will be somewhat around the same level expect for some odd ones (Possibly Italy and Moldova),so there's really no reason why they can't at least have hope.

Now Sudan I haven't seen them play this good in a long time. The big thing about them really is how good their defense is, I mean they qualified for the AFCON over Ghana for crying out loud. Their is a big question though after tying South Sudan and if that could possibly tank their chances on getting second. I really didn't expect them to be challenging DRC and Senegal like this. Especially with everything going on down there.

Now I was thinking of Kosovo and Bosnia as my hotter takes but I wanna wait and see with these upcoming fixtures first. I also was thinking Gabon since they pretty much are beating everyone in their group besides Ivory coast but they do have a tendency to choke. Also Cape Verde is really impressing me a lot, sucks we won't see them at the AFCON. If any of you have any possible answers just put them down below.",16,27,2025-08-30 20:18:27,https://www.reddit.com/r/worldcup/comments/1n4ka9i/underrated_teams_that_could_qualify_for_the_world/,1n4ka9i,"['Hello!

The ethnic clubs based around Italians or Greeks or Croatians have been around for well over 100 years and they seem to have a respectable league setup even if it struggles financially.

A free to air TV channel just started showing one EPL game a week and it\'s getting really good ratings. The Matildas get massive crowds and great TV ratings every match. People always show out for the men\'s team during World Cups too.\xa0\n\n\nThe problem Australia has is there\'s no unified football ""identity"" in the country. In the UK, if you like football then you probably have a club team you watch and support every week, then you watch the national team with keen interest. It\'s a kind of monoculture that way.\n\n\nIn Australia, there\'s tragics like me who follow my local A League club, watch European football and watch the national teams every game. But then there\'s others who don\'t care for the A League and only watch the EPL.

It might already be the case in some areas (GTA, Montreal).\n\nNow the next step is for people to follow ""local"" leagues like MLS and CanPL. It\'s not the case right now, European soccer is by far the most popular.\n\nMLS canadian based clubs have a good local fan base. Some CanPL clubs too like Forge in Hamilton. Still most of the canadians that I know and follow soccer don\'t really care about north american leagues.\n\nAlso I think it\'s not in the north american culture to cheer on your local adult pro/am soccer team that plays in tier 2 / tier 3 division like in Europe. Most of the teams that play in League 1 Ontario (tier 3) for example play their games in front of 20/30 people.\n\nAlso another problem is TV broadcast rights, MLS is on AppleTV, CanPL on a paid service called OneSoccer.

I had this wild crazy dream that Southeast Asia and Oceania would unite to produce a legendary 64 nation world cup,"Just imagine all the possibilities... The best 64 nations in the entire world... Because at some point the world cup will have 64 nations... Blame Infantino and Fifa... And these 64 divided into 4 regions... Each with 4 groups of 4 until the winner of each for then a final four selected in two stadiums... ü•∞Chef Kiss... 

Like, I know that it is too many teams but I see some pros in favour... Less games in qualification rounds, so, they can be shorter and some more time is allowed for other tournments and events... Club world cup that now they are considering being 2 in 2 years, nations league, and the rest... 

We hould have for each of 1 of the 4 regions,  4 main stadiums plus 1 auxiliar for group stages in a total of 16 + 4 stadiums in a bid. Just like 2002 wc with Japan and South Korea of 20 stadiums.

Region 1: IndoChina

Main Stadiums (4)
Thailand‚Äì National Stadium of Bangkok (~50k)

Thailand ‚Äì New World cup stadium planned around Bangkok in Muang Thong Thani (45k) confirmed

Camboja ‚ÄìNational Stadium -  Morodok Techo (60k) Such a wolderful stadium, it kinda is the perfect one for the quarter final and final game of this region... At least in terms of capacity... 

Vietnam‚Äì M·ªπ ƒê√¨nh (40k) 

Auxiliar (1):

Myanmar ‚Äì Thuwunna (50k, needs renovation, myammar preferable for group stages, doesn't have the hospitality required for major games)


Region 2 -  Malaysia + Singapure

Main Stadiums(4)

Malaysia ‚Äì Bukit Jalil national stadium (87k)

Malaysia ‚Äì Shah Alam (45k, new stadium on the lines for a world cup)

Malaysia ‚Äì Sultan Ibrahim (40k)

Singapure ‚Äì National Stadium (50k)

Auxiliar (1):

Mal√°sia ‚Äì Penang/Ipoh (redevelopment of one stadium in one of the cities - either Perak Stadium or State of Penang, ~40k, Ipoh and Penang have solid hospitality for a wc but due to the fact that it still requires a wc worthy stadium it gets to be more of an auxiliar. Maybe State of Penang is a solid choice for a basic stadium)

Region 3 -  Indonesia

Principais (4):

Gelora Bung Karno (77k, Jacarta)

Jakarta International Stadium (82k)

Gelora Bung Tomo (45k, Surabaya)

Batakan (40k, Balikpapan/Samarinda, helped as well in hospitality by the new capital Nusantara) 

the wc can help with some large investment in Nusantara... And as well with the new project for Jakarta to not sink in the ocean... Plus projects like sending down water to the underground soil so that it stops from sinking... The situation is a lot like Mexico City and a little bit of Tokyo but with fewer money than Tokyo for projects and on the coast unlike Mexico City... Surely you can't abandon a city like Jakarta right? 

Auxiliar (1):

Riau Main Stadium (Pekanbaru, 42k, low hospitality capacity, gets to represent the northern island)


Region  4 Australia + New Zealand

Main Stadiums(4) - east coast stadiums selected, non oval stadiums in the line

Sydney ‚Äì Accor Stadium (82k) - the biggest stadium and better one for finals to football... Chance to get a retractable for future events

Sydney ‚Äì Allianz Stadium (42.5k)

Brisbane ‚Äì Suncorp Stadium (55k)

Auckland ‚Äì Eden Park 2.0 (50k, renovation plans of the line, retangular configuration plans on the line to host wc matches - something that New Zealand has already talked about with Infantino - hosting matches with the USA and other pacific islands and countries)

Newcastle ‚Äì McDonald Jones Stadium (42k, the reform in 2011 allowed for the stadium to be used in wc with temporary stands on the north and south, city in the coast but also with a lower hospitality capacity and a much lower importance of the stadium and city compared to the other four)



C'mon, I know that you will call me crazy but it kinda looks good... You then have a final four maybe in Australia, Malaysia or Indonesia... The three countries to have 80k+ capacity stadiums... Like the final four of the nations league... Two stadiums, in this case, 4 matches... All to play for



Edit:

For Australia and New Zealand  - a possible change

Sydney ‚Äì Accor Stadium (82k) -

Melbourne - Melbourne Cricket Ground - can be adapted, a study of Fifa in the stadium envolved rectangular temporary stands for the lower tier on top of the existing ones for better vieweing, capacity reduced to 88k. 
Marvel Stadium is out of the question since it has a private management

Brisbane ‚Äì Suncorp Stadium (55k)

Auckland ‚Äì Eden Park 2.0 (50k)

Auxiliar

Allianz Stadium (42.5k) - it is a perfect stadium to include.  After the few par of group stage matches, it can accomodate easily fan fests and friendly matches during the tournment with a full capacity. The capacity is adequate for that... Large city of Sydney and plenty of interest possible for other matches included in the Fifa package.

FIFA World Cup Volunteer Functional Areas (Which is best) ü§î,"Hey everyone,  


I‚Äôm filling out my FIFA World Cup 2026‚Ñ¢ volunteer application and wanted to get some input from people who have done similar events or know more about the roles.

For my top picks, I mainly put Anti-Doping, Competition Management, Team Services since they sound interesting (not sure if there over-hyping them up though), but I‚Äôm curious about the pros/cons of those compared to other areas.

If you‚Äôve volunteered at past tournaments (FIFA or otherwise), which functional areas did you enjoy the most, and which ones would you recommend avoiding?  


Would love to hear about:

\- What the day-to-day was actually like

\- How busy/relaxed each role felt

\- How much interaction there was with players, officials, or fans

\- Any surprises about the role you picked

\- Open to hearing about any of the functional areas, I just want to make the most of this experience!

Where‚Äôs my right to buy World Cup tickets that I was promised?,"I had bought and attended two club World Cup games as part of a ticket package which was supposed to give me a guaranteed opportunity to get 2026 World Cup tickets. Yet I‚Äôve heard nothing and can‚Äôt find any updates on the status of that. 

What‚Äôs going on here? Did FIFA sell me snake oil?

It‚Äôs frustrating because they have gone on to announce general public ticket opportunities and are being radio silent on this opportunity and how it is going to work.

What bids would you like to see for 38? USA again?,"Technically only the last world cup confederation that has hosted the same can't put a bid for the next WC. Just like in the 80's and 90's Uefa had bids 8 in 8 years... There is really no rule saying that you have to wait 12 years... Only one WC in between... So Uefa is in it... 

Is it time? Uk? 
And... Can Australia and Indonesia bypass the rule and help Ofc to host one wc with a nation of Ofc (New Zealand) in your eyes? The middle east is very far away geographically from Oceania and Southern Asia... Wouldn't they be able to help...
